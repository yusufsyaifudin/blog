It ships with common libraries from logger to active record (for easily querying from database). But, like many current framework in others programming language, we need to write some extra code to make our application easier to observe and debug. For example, on small traffic application we may satisfied by printing some logging such as:\nmyapp | Started GET \u0026#34;/list-vouchers\u0026#34; for 192.168.32.1 at 2023-03-09 03:26:00 +0000 myapp | Cannot render console from 192.168.32.1!

How you will group the log based on one request journey? How can we sorting by time? It is text based, then if you successfully sort that, it probably you\u0026rsquo;re sorting the whole line (not specific by time). And another question on how we get the better sense of the log. The Problem # The default Rails log output is hard to debug. I think it is not only me who feel that. Even ChatGPT tell me this when I asked why rails app log hard to debug:\nFigure 1. ChatGPT's opinion of Rails log outputs Below is the ChatGPT generated text\nRails app logs can be hard to debug for several reasons:\nComplexity: Rails applications can be complex with many layers of code that interact with each other. This can make it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of an issue. Volume: Rails logs can generate a large volume of information, making it difficult to find the relevant information needed to debug an issue. Lack of structure: Rails logs can lack structure, making it difficult to identify the relevant information needed to debug an issue. Lack of context: Rails logs may not provide enough context to understand the flow of the application, making it difficult to understand how the different parts of the application are interacting. Lack of tooling: Traditional text editors or command line tools may not be well suited for analyzing logs, and dedicated log analysis tools can be expensive or require specialized knowledge. To make Rails app logs easier to debug, developers can:\nUse logging frameworks like Lograge or Semantic Logger that provide more structure and context to logs. Configure logging to only include relevant information and to filter out noise. Use log analysis tools like Elasticsearch or Splunk to search, filter, and analyze logs. Implement error tracking tools like Sentry or Airbrake to automatically capture and group errors and provide context for debugging. Use logging libraries like Pry or Byebug to interactively debug code during runtime. End of ChatGPT generated text\nIn this part, I will not talk much about it. I will explain why it become problem in the Part 2 with an example and then try to solve it. But, before jump to solution, I must prepare the clean Rails Application in the Part 1 as I haven\u0026rsquo;t touch the Ruby on Rails for years.\nEach section on each part will always include with the specific commit id. It will help you (and me in the future) to follow the tutorial, so we can reproduce by running git checkout and docker compose up --build --force-recreate, and we will get the similar result as shown in this tutorial.\nUsing OpenTelemetry to Trace User Journey # OpenTelemetry came as a set of standard to make developer (and also ops) easier to see the application traces, metrics and logs by instrumenting the code. But, when this tutorial is written, the OpenTelemetry SDK for Ruby version 1.2.0 (with commit id ad7c3b9c4fcdf2f74705a9ac08310b7067e97162) not supports OpenTelemetry Metric and Logging.\nFigure 2. OpenTelemetry Ruby SDK Page So, as the workaround to make standard logging that can be linked to the trace, we need to implement the OTEP0114 which add these property in our existing log output:\n\u0026ldquo;trace_id\u0026rdquo; hex-encoded. \u0026ldquo;span_id\u0026rdquo; hex-encoded. \u0026ldquo;trace_flags\u0026rdquo; formatted according to W3C traceflags format. References:\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.18.0/specification/logs/README.md?plain=1#L474-L526 https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/pull/114 Using JSON as the Log Format Output # In the OpenTelemetry page discussing Trace Context in Legacy Formats, there no advice to use JSON format over the Syslog RFC5424 or other format. But in my opinion, using JSON as the log format output will make debugging more easier because it can be stored into NoSQL database and then query it. In result, by able to query the logs, we can group the logs based on trace_id which means that all logs with the same trace_id are produced by the one request journey from the client.\nFigure 3.

If you already know about the Rails and want to only focusing on how to make the logs better, you can skip this part and jump to Part 2.\nPrepare Rails Application # To make this tutorial is easier to follow both for experienced RoR developers and newcomers, I will create easy to follow step by step tutorial from installing Rails to adding OpenTelemetry library to customize the log output in Rails application. I hope it also gives you (the reader) idea on how adding OpenTelemetry on your existing code.\nWARNING!!!\nAll code in this tutorial is not production ready! For example, I don\u0026rsquo;t validate JWT token but only decode it.\nInstalling Rails # I will not tell you to install Ruby and Rails in your host machine. I suggest you to install Docker by following this link:\nInstall on Mac https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/ Install on Windows https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ Install on Linux https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/ Then you can pull the Docker Ruby image:\ndocker pull ruby:3-bullseye This command will pull the Docker image Ruby with version 3 using Debian codename \u0026ldquo;bullseye\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, save this file as create-rails.sh in your project directory. For example, you create the project directory in ~/Project, then save it as ~/Project/create-rails.sh.\nThis is the script to install Rails version 7.0.4.2 and create new Rails project with name rails-otel.\n#!/bin/sh gem install rails -v 7.0.4.2 rails new rails-otel Then we can create a Rails project by running this command in your project directory (from the same location where you save the create-rails.sh file):\ndocker run -v $(pwd)/rails-otel:/rails-otel -v $(pwd)/create-rails.sh:/create-rails.sh:ro ruby:3-bullseye /bin/bash create-rails.sh Above command will tell Docker to run Docker image ruby:3-bullseye by mounting two volumes:\n$(pwd)/rails-otel:/rails-otel means that we will make any files written by Docker container to persist in our host machine. $(pwd)/create-rails.sh:/create-rails.sh:ro tells Docker to include the create-rails.sh file from host machine to the container with read only mode. This is file that we need to run inside the Docker container. Then argument /bin/bash create-rails.sh tells Docker to run that command inside the Docker container ruby:3-bullseye.\nNow, in the project directory ~/Project you will find new folder containing the Rails code in ~/Project/rails-otel.\nYay! We have created a clean Rails project without installing Ruby and gem Rails in our host machine!\nYou can see it in this commit: 8540614\nRunning Rails using Docker # Now, we already have clean Ruby on Rails project, and it will means nothing if we don\u0026rsquo;t run it. Again, since we don\u0026rsquo;t install any Ruby nor gem install rails in our host machine, we need to run it using Docker too.\nFirst, create a file with name entrypoint.sh in the Rails project:\n#!/bin/bash set -e # Remove a potentially pre-existing server.pid for Rails. rm -f /myapp/tmp/pids/server.pid # Then exec the container\u0026#39;s main process (what\u0026#39;s set as CMD in the Dockerfile). exec \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; As you can read in the comment, it needed to remove any potential pre-existing server.pid for Rails to run.\nThen, create another file named development.Docker in the root Rails project directory:\nFROM ruby:3-bullseye RUN apt-get update -qq # Set workdir to \u0026#34;myapp\u0026#34; WORKDIR /myapp # Copy Gemfile and download all Gem required to run. # This minimize the build time because `bundle` doesn\u0026#39;t need to scan all source code. COPY Gemfile /myapp/Gemfile COPY Gemfile.lock /myapp/Gemfile.lock RUN bundle install # Add a script to be executed every time the container starts. COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/bin/ RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/entrypoint.sh EXPOSE 3000 ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;entrypoint.sh\u0026#34;] What we do here is copying Gemfile and Gemfile.lock into Docker container with base image ruby:3-bullseye. After that, we run bundle install to download all gem dependencies required by our Rails application to run.\nThen, we copy entrypoint.sh make it executable by apply chmod +x permission into it and make it as Docker ENTRYPOINT. We also add EXPOSE 3000 to tell Docker to expose port number 3000.\nYou may ask where we put the rest of our Ruby code? Why it didn\u0026rsquo;t COPYed to container?\nThe answer of this question is: No, we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to copy our file into Docker container. Because, in this part what we only need is to run Rails application inside Docker container, and we can modify the code via any IDE installed in our host. In this part, our goal is not to make final Docker image to be deployed somewhere, but we use Docker as our development environment.\nFinally, to make easier to run, we can use Docker Compose by creating new file named docker-compose.yml:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; services: myapp: container_name: myapp build: dockerfile: development.Dockerfile restart: always command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b \u0026#39;0.0.0.0\u0026#39; ports: - \u0026#34;3000:3000\u0026#34; volumes: - ./:/myapp In above code, we name our Rails application as myapp with Dockerfile referenced to the file development.Dockerfile we have created above. Then we mount the volume ./:/myapp which means that myapp service will have access of all files in the host current directory and mapped it into /myapp directory inside the Docker container.\nThen we need to run command bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0' for Rails application to run in port 3000.\nAfter creating those 3 files (Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh and docker-compose.yml) we can run our Rails app by executing this command:\ndocker compose up --build --force-recreate We will see our terminal similar like this:\nFigure 1. Running Rails using Docker Compose Now, access your browser at http://localhost:3000 it should look like this:\nFigure 2. RoR homepage on fresh install You can see all changes of this section on this commit: 1502a09\nAdd route mimicking nested function calls operation # As this article is focusing on how we can get better observability of the logs emitted by Rails application, we need add one route in our router that do nested function calls. This mimicking the real-world application, where one API may do several function calls (or sometimes 3rd party call) before it return response to the user.\nFor this tutorial, I will create a router where user can apply a Voucher code. I will create the route:\nGET /list-vouchers?token=jwt-token Which will return list of promotion voucher code that can only be accessed by the user (so we need to check whether the user is exists in database or not).\nThe response will looks like this:\n[ { \u0026#34;user\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f2c2d7ba-0d2b-4f2d-8a6c-6b3a69c8d87e\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;created_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-02-28T11:08:36.000Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;updated_at\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-02-28T11:08:38.000Z\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;vouchers\u0026#34;: [ [ { \u0026#34;voucher_code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;REGISTER_ANNIVERSARY\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;will get 5% discount if user is a loyal users (already joined minimum 1 year)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;terms_and_conditions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;discount\u0026#34;: 5, \u0026#34;min_registered_year\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;registered_date_is_same\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;registered_month_is_same\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;name_prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } ] } ] ] } ] In this process, we need to:\nGet the Authorization token, either from Header or query params. Parse the JWT, and get the user id from token. Check if the user id is exists on the database. Call service Promotions (for now we create a Class that return static output) if user is exist in database, otherwise return error. This article only focus to show you how to create better logging, so there is may security hole in the code.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s code that!\nPreparing Postgres Database and Gem Library To Connect # Before we create any Ruby code, we need a database to be use by our code. We use Postgres 15 using Docker.\nFirst, stop our previous docker run command (docker compose up --build --force-recreate) in the terminal by using CTRL + C. Then command docker compose down to make sure all container is stopped.\nThen, in our docker-compose.yml file, change to this:\nversion: \u0026#39;3.8\u0026#39; services: myapp: container_name: myapp build: dockerfile: development.Dockerfile restart: always command: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b \u0026#39;0.0.0.0\u0026#39; ports: - \u0026#34;3000:3000\u0026#34; volumes: - ./:/myapp depends_on: - postgres environment: DATABASE_USERNAME: root DATABASE_PASSWORD: password postgres: image: postgres:15 container_name: postgres restart: always ports: - \u0026#34;5433:5432\u0026#34; environment: - POSTGRES_USER=root - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password - POSTGRES_DB=postgres - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=\u0026#34;--data-checksums\u0026#34; volumes: - ./docker-data/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data - ./docker-postgres-init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/docker-postgres-init.sql:ro This will tell Docker to add new container postgres:15 with username root and password password. And passing this credentials to myapp container.\nThen, as we specified in the volumes section, we need to create a file with name docker-postgres-init.sql in our root project directory:\nCREATE DATABASE rails_otel_dev; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE rails_otel_dev TO root; This will tell the Postgres to create 3 databases (rails_otel_dev, rails_otel_test, and rails_otel_prod) when first run. All data will be persisted in ./docker-data/postgres as we mount our Docker volume into it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to add docker-data in the .gitignore to ensure that all data created by Postgres is not committed to our Git repo.\n37 # Ignore IDE index file 38 /.idea + 39 docker-data 40 Then, to make our Rails application can connect to Postgres, we need to add pg Gem library, by adding to the Gemfile:\n50 + 51 # Pg is the Ruby interface to the PostgreSQL RDBMS.

So, I may not write long explanation about what the code is doing, and just put the file name and code.\nNow, we need to create model to interact with our table in file app/models/user.rb:\nclass User \u0026lt; ApplicationRecord end This is for Rails application to interact with the users table we create before.\nThen create a file in app/externals/promotions/promotion_service.rb:\nmodule Promotions class PromotionService def self.list_vouchers() # random sleep from 100ms to 500ms s = (rand(100...500).to_f/1000).to_f # divide by 1000 to get millisecond Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;PromotionService.list_vouchers call started\u0026#34; sleep(s) Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;PromotionService.list_vouchers done\u0026#34; return [ [ \u0026#39;voucher_code\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;REGISTER_ANNIVERSARY\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;description\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;will get 5% discount if user is a loyal users (already joined minimum 1 year)\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;terms_and_conditions\u0026#39;: [ \u0026#39;discount\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 5, \u0026#39;min_registered_year\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, \u0026#39;registered_date_is_same\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;registered_month_is_same\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; true, \u0026#39;name_prefix\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, ] ], [ \u0026#39;voucher_code\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;I_AM_JAN\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;description\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;will get 1% discount if user have name prefix \u0026#39;jan\u0026#39; because our app is launched at January!\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;terms_and_conditions\u0026#39;: [ \u0026#39;discount\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 1, \u0026#39;min_registered_year\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; 0, \u0026#39;registered_date_is_same\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; false, \u0026#39;registered_month_is_same\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; false, \u0026#39;name_prefix\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, ] ] ] end end end This to mimicking external service that we need to call via network (either HTTP or gRPC, and that\u0026rsquo;s the reason why I put it under app/externals directory). Supposed that we designed our system using microservice architecture, we may split into several separated service and we call it from main application. But, instead writing some real another service and call it, in this section I write a hard-coded object in class PromotionService that mimicking the response of the Promotions service when we request list of voucher code. Since this code will never return error, I added some sleep operation mimicking the network call latency and some logger before and after it.\nNow, create another file app/services/vouchers/user_voucher.rb that do the main business logic:\nGet user information from database Call the PromotionService above and return the user object and list of vouchers. module Vouchers class UserVoucher def self.vouchers(user_id) Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;reaching business logic\u0026#34; Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;doing query get user by id #{user_id}\u0026#34; user = User::find_by(:id =\u0026gt; user_id) throw :NotFoundUser if user.nil?

To do that, we need to install some gem in our Gemfile:\n53 + 54 # A pure ruby implementation of the RFC 7519 OAuth JSON Web Token (JWT) standard. + 55 gem \u0026#39;jwt\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;~\u0026gt; 2.7\u0026#39; + 56 We install library jwt to decode and encode the JWT.\nThen create a file lib/json_web_token.rb:\nclass JsonWebToken def self.encode(payload) return JWT.encode(payload, Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base) end def self.decode(token) Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;validating JWT\u0026#34; return JWT.decode(token, Rails.application.secrets.secret_key_base) rescue nil end end Now, let\u0026rsquo;s create the controller and route for it.\nWe need add library responders since we need respond_to method that are no longer a part of Rails. In Gemfile add this line:\n+ 56 + 57 # A set of Rails responders to dry up your application + 58 gem \u0026#39;responders\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;~\u0026gt; 3.1\u0026#39; + 59 Then change the file app/controllers/application_controller.rb into this to register the function loaded in controllers.\n1 class ApplicationController \u0026lt; ActionController::Base + 2 include ActionController::MimeResponds 3 end 4 After that, create the controller file app/controllers/UserPromotionController.rb:\nrequire_dependency \u0026#34;json_web_token\u0026#34; class UserPromotionController \u0026lt; ApplicationController def list_vouchers Rails.logger.debug \u0026#34;request accepted by controller\u0026#34; begin token = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; auth = request.headers[\u0026#39;Authorization\u0026#39;] if !auth.nil? token = auth.split(\u0026#39; \u0026#39;).last end if token.empty?

After that we pass this user_id to UserVoucher::vouchers(user_id) which we defined in app/services/vouchers/user_voucher.rb.\nBut, this controller cannot be accessed until we register the routes.\nRegistering Routes # First, we need to make sure all our previous code loaded by Rails by adding this line in config/application.rb:\nconfig.watchable_dirs[\u0026#39;lib\u0026#39;] = [:rb] Then register our controller in config/routes.rb:\nget \u0026#39;list-vouchers\u0026#39;, to: \u0026#39;user_promotion#list_vouchers\u0026#39; Done! Please re-run the command docker compose up --build --force-recreate again. It will install the library jwt and responders.\nNow we have the routes that can be accessed http://localhost:3000/list-vouchers?token=jwt.access.token. But, we don\u0026rsquo;t have any real user saved in our Postgres and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any JSON Web Token yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to next section!\nYou can see changes in this section here: c85c199\nInsert User data and Create JWT access token via rails console # We can invoke and run any code of our code by launching the rails console.

This can make it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of an issue.\nAs you can see in Figure 4, when we have high traffic, the Rails log become hard to read because some log may delayed to print, so we cannot see the right order of the logs line. If we adding the timestamp at the front of each log lines, we still cannot get the better understanding because it is uncommon to sorting the unstructured logs. See also #Lack of context.\nRails logs can generate a large volume of information, making it difficult to find the relevant information needed to debug an issue.\nAlso, since the we have a large volumes of log, we need a good tooling which can be easier to query and filter to show log that we need to see.\nLack of structure # Rails logs can lack structure, making it difficult to identify the relevant information needed to debug an issue.\nStructured log is easier to query and makes developer easier to pin-point the issues. For example, the Customer Service got the complaint from User U at time T that the application become unresponsive. The Customer Service then can open the ticket and let the developer to see the log only for that user at that time. If we still have unstructured log as shown in Figure 4, how we can do that?\nIf we have a structured log, (let say JSON formatted), we can pipe all these logs into Elasticsearch and query it using Kibana (or renowned as ELK Stack. As an alternative, we can use Grafana Loki to query it from Cassandra or AWS DynamoDB. JSON is preferred because developers should familiar with that kind of format as it commonly used in REST API request/response payload.\nLack of context # Rails logs may not provide enough context to understand the flow of the application, making it difficult to understand how the different parts of the application are interacting.\nAt Figure 4, we see Completed 200 OK three times at the end of the logs. But, how can we know the previous process that related to this line? Why at first we got 496ms, then 371ms and then 319ms? If at some point we see the number is more than 10 seconds, how can we know the related log that causing the process took too long?\nLack of tooling # Traditional text editors or command line tools may not be well suited for analyzing logs, and dedicated log analysis tools can be expensive or require specialized knowledge.\nAs I mention in #Lack of structure, it is more easier to query using JSON that text. Even if we are only using terminal, with JSON we can do some query using jq or its alternative gojq. But, I do prefer if we save it into some persistent storage (with some TTL to reduce cost of storage) and query them via dashboard UI (like Grafana Loki or Kibana).\nRefactoring Log Output To Structured Log # After we acknowledge that there is a problem with our Rails app, we can then try to improve our log starting with making it as JSON output per log line.\nWe will refactor our log output to JSON, with this minimal structure:\n{ \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;INFO\u0026#34;, // Required.

Changes on this section can be seen at this commit 21a4666.\nAdd OpenTelemetry SDK # Before configuring the rest of logger to JSON, we need to add OpenTelemetry to get the actual trace_id and span_id. This is the advantages using OpenTelemetry SDK:\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t need to re-invent the wheel on how ID should be generated and formatted. If we have enough budget, we can deploy Jaeger or Grafana or using provider such as DataDog or NewRelic to see our app trace. Then we can also correlate logs and traces with the same trace_id. But, if we don\u0026rsquo;t have enough resources (either human resource or infrastructure), we can disable OpenTelemetry to push and just use the SDK itself to generate. First, we need to install OpenTelemetry Gem SDK:\n+ 60 # A stats collection and distributed tracing framework + 61 gem \u0026#39;opentelemetry-sdk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;1.2\u0026#39; + 62 + 63 # OTLP exporter for the OpenTelemetry framework + 64 gem \u0026#39;opentelemetry-exporter-otlp\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;0.24.0\u0026#39; + 65 + 66 # All-in-one instrumentation bundle for the OpenTelemetry framework + 67 # Provides instrumentations for Rails, Sinatra, several HTTP libraries, and more. + 68 gem \u0026#39;opentelemetry-instrumentation-all\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;0.31.0\u0026#39; + 69 Then, create a file config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb with following code:\nrequire \u0026#39;opentelemetry/sdk\u0026#39; require \u0026#39;opentelemetry/exporter/otlp\u0026#39; require \u0026#39;opentelemetry/instrumentation/all\u0026#39; # Custom exporter to make print to STDOUT class MyExporter \u0026lt; OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter # Override function here: # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/exporter/otlp/lib/opentelemetry/exporter/otlp/exporter.rb#L79-L90 def export(span_data, timeout: nil) # Custom logic for exporting data goes here STDOUT.puts(\u0026#34;Exporting data: #{span_data.inspect}\u0026#34;) return OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::SUCCESS end end # Exporter and Processor configuration # See list of arguments here https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/exporter/otlp/lib/opentelemetry/exporter/otlp/exporter.rb#L48-L54 # As of March 15th, 2023, the gRPC exporter is not published to Rubygems and marked as not production ready. # See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/issues/1337 # So, we can only use HTTP for now. OTEL_EXPORTER = OpenTelemetry::Exporter::OTLP::Exporter.new( endpoint: ENV[\u0026#39;OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT\u0026#39;], ) # Use this custom exporter if we want to log into STDOUT only, or implement another exporter (such as no-operation). # OTEL_EXPORTER = MyExporter.new() # See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/sdk/lib/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/export/batch_span_processor.rb#L47-L53 processor = OpenTelemetry::SDK::Trace::Export::BatchSpanProcessor.new(OTEL_EXPORTER) OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c| c.resource = OpenTelemetry::SDK::Resources::Resource.create({ OpenTelemetry::SemanticConventions::Resource::SERVICE_NAMESPACE =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;rails-app\u0026#39;, OpenTelemetry::SemanticConventions::Resource::SERVICE_NAME =\u0026gt; PROGRAM_NAME.to_s, # Global variable PROGRAM_NAME already defined in config/boot.rb OpenTelemetry::SemanticConventions::Resource::SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID =\u0026gt; Socket.gethostname(), OpenTelemetry::SemanticConventions::Resource::SERVICE_VERSION =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;0.0.0\u0026#34;, # we can get it from environment variable }) # enables all instrumentation! c.use_all() # Or, if you prefer to filter specific instrumentation, # you can pick some of them like this https://scoutapm.com/blog/configuring-opentelemetry-in-ruby ##### Instruments # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rack\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionPack\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActionView\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActiveJob\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ActiveRecord\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::ConcurrentRuby\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Faraday\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::HttpClient\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Net::HTTP\u0026#39; # c.use \u0026#39;OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::PG\u0026#39;, { # # By default, this instrumentation includes the executed SQL as the `db.statement` # # semantic attribute.

But, if you wish to not send it, we can only print it (or entirely disable it) by using custom OpenTelemetry exporter MyExporter and change the exporter to OTEL_EXPORTER = MyExporter.new().\nThen, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to shutdown the OpenTelemetry exporter during app shutdown.\nIn file config/application.rb, add this following line:\n+ 23 + 24 # Add a callback to shut down the OpenTelemetry exporter and SDK + 25 config.after_initialize do + 26 at_exit do + 27 OTEL_EXPORTER.shutdown + 28 end + 29 end + 30 Now, we have OpenTelemetry SDK installed. Next, we need to use OpenTelemetry Collector as agent to receives the traces produced by our app and Jaeger as the dashboard. To do that, we can add this service in our docker-compose.yaml:\njaeger: image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1 container_name: jaeger restart: always command: - \u0026#39;--collector.otlp.enabled=true\u0026#39; ports: - \u0026#34;5775:5775/udp\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;6831:6831/udp\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;6832:6832/udp\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;5778:5778\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;16686:16686\u0026#34; # dashboard - \u0026#34;14268:14268\u0026#34; # Accepts spans directly from clients in jaeger.thrift format with binary thrift protocol (POST to /api/traces).

myapp | Changes on this section can be seen at this commit 2c5eb6f.\nDuck-typing the Ruby::Logger # In previous sub-section, we use Ruby::Logger as the OpenTelemetry SDK Logger. Since we use Ruby 3.2.1 in Gemfile, it should refer to this Ruby Logger.\nSo, we can actually duck-type the Ruby logger formatter class to format our log into JSON, by defining class and method argument same as in this source or in this commit.\nTo do that, create file config/logger_json.rb:\nclass Logger::Formatter def call(severity, time, program_name, message) json_log = { level: severity, time: time, msg: message, trace_id: \u0026#39;00000000000000000000000000000000\u0026#39;, span_id: \u0026#39;0000000000000000\u0026#39;, trace_flags: \u0026#39;00\u0026#39;, node_id: RAILS_NODE_ID, progname: program_name || PROGRAM_NAME, }.to_json STDOUT.puts(json_log) end end And in file config/boot.rb, add:\nrequire_relative \u0026#34;logger_json\u0026#34; Now, if you recreate the Docker container, it will show all JSON log.\nChanges on this section can be seen at this commit 52d0dca.\nDuck-typing the Ruby ActiveRecord Logger # References of this section:\nhttps://unfit-for.work/posts/2023/rails-structured-logging/ https://medium.com/gojekengineering/structured-logging-in-rails-75e9a8c5370b https://cbpowell.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/beautiful-logging-for-ruby-on-rails-4/ If we access the URL http://localhost:3000/list-vouchers?token={your-token} we still get the non-JSON formatted log.

Now, as we already add the Jaeger service in the section Add OpenTelemetry SDK, we can see our trace in Jaeger dashboard by accessing JaegerUI http://localhost:16686/search.\nAnd we will see one trace like this (because we only do request once only):\nFigure 8. JaegerUI To See App Trace In our log we see that we have a trace id 4862c816e54cf50f3d0147068a88ccc7 and, it match with the Trace ID shown in JaegerUI in http://localhost:16686/trace/4862c816e54cf50f3d0147068a88ccc7.\nSo, we have two questions:\nHow to make this trace id available from the client side? To do this, we want to add key Traceparent available in HTTP response header by creating OpenTelemetry Middleware. This comply with the W3 Recommendation. What is additional function with suffixes _ctx such as debug_ctx, info_ctx, etc do? And how to use that? I will cover it in the section Changes on this section can be seen at this commit e7ad9f7.\nCreating OpenTelemetry Middleware # We need to create a OpenTelemetry middleware in the first middleware stack to ensure:\nIf the endpoint is called from another service that already start the tracer, we only need to continue from that tracer ID as the parent. If we don\u0026rsquo;t do this, it will create new trace that not correlate with the previous trace \u0026ndash; and this is bad, because we can\u0026rsquo;t observe and correlate the API calls. We add Traceparent in response header. This way, the caller (or client who call the app) can see the Trace ID produced by the app. We print access log in this middleware to ensure we can get request-response log. To do that, create a file config/middleware_otel.rb:\nrequire \u0026#39;securerandom\u0026#39; require \u0026#34;opentelemetry/sdk\u0026#34; require \u0026#39;rack/request\u0026#39; require_relative \u0026#34;logger_active_record_json\u0026#34; # # Export traces to console by default # # see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/sdk/lib/opentelemetry/sdk/configurator.rb#L175-L197 # ENV[\u0026#39;OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER\u0026#39;] ||= \u0026#39;otlp\u0026#39; # # Configure propagator # # see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/sdk/lib/opentelemetry/sdk/configurator.rb#L199-L216 # ENV[\u0026#39;OTEL_PROPAGATORS\u0026#39;] ||= \u0026#39;tracecontext,baggage,b3\u0026#39; # MiddlewareLogger this code is based on below link with modification. # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/examples/http/server.rb module MiddlewareLogger class RequestContextMiddleware def initialize(app) @app = app end def call(env) start_time = Time.now # Extract context from request headers. # This to continue the span if client has sent some propagator key into request header. context = OpenTelemetry.propagation.extract( env, # see https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/common/lib/opentelemetry/common/propagation.rb#L22 # and https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby/blob/opentelemetry-sdk/v1.2.0/common/lib/opentelemetry/common/propagation/rack_env_getter.rb getter: OpenTelemetry::Common::Propagation.rack_env_getter, ) # Example: get OpenTelemetry trace id. # Trace ID will always the same as traceparent (if exist and continue from client), # or from new current span. # trace_id = OpenTelemetry::Trace.current_span.context.trace_id.unpack1(\u0026#39;H*\u0026#39;) # Unpack to hex # We use MyAppTracer that we defined in config/initializers/opentelemetry.rb # For attribute naming, see # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.19.0/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md#http-server attributes = { \u0026#39;component\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;http\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;http.method\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; env[\u0026#39;REQUEST_METHOD\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;http.route\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; env[\u0026#39;PATH_INFO\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;http.url\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; env[\u0026#39;REQUEST_URI\u0026#39;], } # Span name SHOULD be set to route: span_name = \u0026#34;#{env[\u0026#39;REQUEST_METHOD\u0026#39;]} #{env[\u0026#39;PATH_INFO\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34; span = MyAppTracer.start_span(span_name, with_parent: context, attributes: attributes) # Extract relevant information from the request object # see full object here https://rubydoc.info/gems/rack/Rack/Request request = Rack::Request.new(env) req_method = request.request_method || \u0026#39;\u0026#39; req_path = request.path || \u0026#39;\u0026#39; req_url = env[\u0026#39;REQUEST_URI\u0026#39;] || \u0026#39;\u0026#39; req_user_agent = request.user_agent || \u0026#39;\u0026#39; req_remote_ip = request.ip || \u0026#39;\u0026#39; # Get X-Request-ID value header.

For example, in access log we need a data with structure:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;request\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;response\u0026#34;: {} } } But in another case such as publishing message to Kafka we only want to produce data with:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;kafka_topic\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payload\u0026#34;: {} } } Also, we accept the 3rd arguments as an optional parameter. It can accepts any value as long as it can be decoded into JSON (i.e: Hash as JSON object, Array as JSON array, etc). It useful when we want to add some information that only available in certain function. For example, we cannot get the username from the access log because the OpenTelemetry middleware should be installed in the first stack (in the sample code we place it in the business logic level code), so it cannot be printed in the middleware. username value is only available after this line.\nSo, we can change our code a bit.\nFrom:\nRails.logger.debug \u0026#34;calling PromotionService.list_vouchers from UserVoucher.list_vouchers #{user_id}\u0026#34; That produces log:\n{\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;DEBUG\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-04-03T10:43:45.525+00:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;msg\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;calling PromotionService.list_vouchers from UserVoucher.list_vouchers c8c6991c-687e-44cc-8755-4743ef66d265\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;trace_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;26136c1a589d1a1735e517f36a4c71ed\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;span_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;f32d0b8848232ea8\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;trace_flags\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1312c7ba-d448-42a5-95d5-0bb32b837d61\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;progname\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;rails-otel\u0026#34;} To:\nRails.logger.debug_ctx( \u0026#34;calling PromotionService.list_vouchers from UserVoucher.list_vouchers\u0026#34;, nil, {username: user.username}, ) That produces:\n{\u0026#34;level\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;DEBUG\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-04-03T10:44:38.701+00:00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;msg\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;calling PromotionService.list_vouchers from UserVoucher.list_vouchers\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;trace_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;6c93b69dd5e395f20c5338375a540bd5\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;span_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;72a37953b7e9cd79\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;trace_flags\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;00\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;node_id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1312c7ba-d448-42a5-95d5-0bb32b837d61\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;progname\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;rails-otel\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;attributes\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;jane\u0026#34;}]} Changes on this section can be seen at this commit 81ffd38.\nBonus: Add Trace using OpenTelemetry # When you see on Figure 8, you see that in one request there will be 25 spans.

To make it visible, we need to wrap our code with this block:\nMyAppTracer.in_span(\u0026#34;your span name\u0026#34;) do |span| # the rest of your code that want be traced end This is documented here on the release tag 2023.04.\nNow, if we access our app, the JaegerUI tracing will show as shown in Figure 18.\ncurl -v http://localhost:3000/list-vouchers\\?token\\=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYzhjNjk5MWMtNjg3ZS00NGNjLTg3NTUtNDc0M2VmNjZkMjY1In0.TCrEUFziQY4800jAT9ioY2mOm_b9eLdC20gtXjdTt14 * Trying 127.0.0.1:3000... * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3000 (#0) \u0026gt; GET /list-vouchers?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoiYzhjNjk5MWMtNjg3ZS00NGNjLTg3NTUtNDc0M2VmNjZkMjY1In0.TCrEUFziQY4800jAT9ioY2mOm_b9eLdC20gtXjdTt14 HTTP/1.1 \u0026gt; Host: localhost:3000 \u0026gt; User-Agent: curl/7.86.0 \u0026gt; Accept: */* \u0026gt; * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse \u0026lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK \u0026lt; X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN \u0026lt; X-XSS-Protection: 0 \u0026lt; X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff \u0026lt; X-Download-Options: noopen \u0026lt; X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none \u0026lt; Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin \u0026lt; Content-Type: */*; charset=utf-8 \u0026lt; Vary: Accept \u0026lt; ETag: W/\u0026#34;0a89d7478ece4a7e8d2b8acbc102aff6\u0026#34; \u0026lt; Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate \u0026lt; X-Request-Id: d8c74eb4-4b80-4824-a40d-f82881b3bba2 \u0026lt; X-Runtime: 0.411438 \u0026lt; Server-Timing: start_processing.action_controller;dur=0.64, sql.active_record;dur=3.71, instantiation.active_record;dur=0.44, process_action.action_controller;dur=377.52 \u0026lt; traceparent: 00-a8f1b4a938dd800bef349037d25b9524-f63a980145e5e597-01 \u0026lt; Transfer-Encoding: chunked \u0026lt; * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact {\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;c8c6991c-687e-44cc-8755-4743ef66d265\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;jane\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Jane Kepiye Karepe To\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;created_at\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-03-02T09:15:51.346Z\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;updated_at\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2023-03-02T09:15:51.346Z\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;vouchers\u0026#34;:[[{\u0026#34;voucher_code\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;REGISTER_ANNIVERSARY\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;will get 5% discount if user is a loyal users (already joined minimum 1 year)\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;terms_and_conditions\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;discount\u0026#34;:5,\u0026#34;min_registered_year\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;registered_date_is_same\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;registered_month_is_same\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;name_prefix\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}]}],[{\u0026#34;voucher_code\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;I_AM_JAN\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;description\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;will get 1% discount if user have name prefix \u0026#39;jan\u0026#39; because our app is launched at January!\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;terms_and_conditions\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;discount\u0026#34;:1,\u0026#34;min_registered_year\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;registered_date_is_same\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;registered_month_is_same\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;name_prefix\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;}]}]]}% Figure 18.

Now we can pipe this log into Elasticsearch or any logging tools that support query. By using that, we can easily to group the log based on trace_id.\n"}]
